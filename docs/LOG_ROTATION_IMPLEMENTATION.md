# Log Rotation Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented 24-hour log rotation for both MCP server entry points using Python's built-in `TimedRotatingFileHandler`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `src/d365fo_client/mcp/main.py`
- **Import Addition**: Added `import logging.handlers` 
- **Enhanced `setup_logging()` function**:
  - Replaced `logging.basicConfig()` with manual handler configuration
  - Implemented `TimedRotatingFileHandler` for file logging
  - Added separate console handler for stderr output
  - Both handlers use the same formatter for consistency

### 2. Updated `src/d365fo_client/mcp/fastmcp_main.py`
- **Import Addition**: Added `import logging.handlers`
- **Enhanced `setup_logging()` function**:
  - Replaced simple `StreamHandler` setup with comprehensive logging configuration
  - Implemented `TimedRotatingFileHandler` for file logging
  - Added separate console handler for stderr output
  - Both handlers use the same formatter for consistency

## Log Rotation Configuration

### Rotation Settings
- **When**: `midnight` - Logs rotate at midnight local time
- **Interval**: `1` - Every 1 day
- **Backup Count**: `30` - Keep 30 days of historical logs
- **Encoding**: `utf-8` - Ensures proper character handling
- **UTC**: `False` - Uses local time for rotation scheduling

### Log File Locations
- **Standard MCP Server**: `~/.d365fo-mcp/logs/mcp-server.log`
- **FastMCP Server**: `~/.d365fo-mcp/logs/fastmcp-server.log`

### Log File Naming Pattern
When rotation occurs, log files are renamed with date suffixes:
- Current log: `mcp-server.log`
- Previous day: `mcp-server.log.2025-09-12`
- Two days ago: `mcp-server.log.2025-09-11`
- etc.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Automatic Rotation
- Logs automatically rotate at midnight every day
- No manual intervention required
- Rotation happens seamlessly without stopping the server

### 2. Historical Log Retention
- Keeps 30 days of historical logs automatically
- Older logs are automatically deleted to prevent disk space issues
- Configurable backup count if needed in the future

### 3. Proper Log Management
- Handles existing handlers cleanup to prevent duplicate logging
- Ensures both file and console logging work correctly
- Maintains consistent formatting across all log outputs

### 4. Error Handling
- Proper file creation and directory management
- UTF-8 encoding prevents character encoding issues
- Graceful handling of log directory creation

## Benefits

### 1. Disk Space Management
- Automatic cleanup of old logs prevents disk space exhaustion
- 30-day retention provides sufficient historical data for troubleshooting

### 2. Operational Excellence
- Daily rotation makes log files manageable for analysis
- Consistent naming convention enables automated log processing
- Timestamps in filenames allow easy chronological sorting

### 3. Debugging and Monitoring
- Separate log files for different server types
- Historical logs preserved for trend analysis and debugging
- Console output still available for real-time monitoring

### 4. Production Readiness
- Standard logging practices for production environments
- Compatible with log management and monitoring tools
- Minimal performance impact on server operations

## Testing Verified
- ✅ TimedRotatingFileHandler correctly configured
- ✅ Log files created in proper directory structure
- ✅ Both file and console logging work simultaneously
- ✅ Proper UTF-8 encoding and formatting
- ✅ No syntax errors in updated code
- ✅ Import statements work correctly

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
1. **Configurable rotation settings** - Allow users to customize rotation timing
2. **Compression** - Add gzip compression for rotated logs to save space
3. **Log level configuration** - Per-handler log level settings
4. **External log forwarding** - Integration with centralized logging systems
5. **Log file size limits** - Additional rotation based on file size

## Implementation Notes
- Uses Python standard library only (no additional dependencies)
- Backward compatible with existing logging configuration
- Thread-safe rotation suitable for production environments
- Local time-based rotation aligns with operational schedules
