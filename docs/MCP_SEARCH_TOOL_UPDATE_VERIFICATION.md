#### Before:
```
User: "Get data management entities"
AI: Searches for ".*data.*management.*" (literal interpretation)
```

#### After:
```
User: "Get data management entities" 
AI: 
1. Extracts keywords: "data", "management"
2. Creates patterns: ".*[Dd]ata.*", ".*[Mm]anagement.*"
3. Performs 2 separate searches
4. Analyzes overlap to find entities matching both concepts
```

### 4. Technical Validation
