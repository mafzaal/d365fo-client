## Key Features

### Analysis Types

1. **Manual Sequences Analysis**
   - Identifies all manually configured sequences
   - Analyzes manual override patterns and security risks
   - Reviews access controls and permissions

2. **Entity References Analysis**
   - Maps entity-to-sequence relationships
   - Identifies orphaned or unused sequences
   - Validates reference consistency across scopes

3. **Configuration Review**
   - Validates sequence configuration consistency
   - Checks scope alignment between tables
   - Reviews format and interval settings

4. **Usage Patterns Analysis**
   - Analyzes sequence utilization rates
   - Identifies sequences approaching limits
   - Reviews performance and preallocation settings

5. **Comprehensive Analysis**
   - Combines all analysis types
   - Provides complete sequence health assessment
   - Generates actionable recommendations

### Data Sources

The prompt automatically retrieves data from:
- **SequenceV2Tables** - Main sequence configuration
- **NumberSequencesV2References** - Entity-to-sequence mappings
- **NumberSequenceScope** - Scope definitions
- **Parameter tables** - CustParameters, VendParameters, etc.

### Risk Indicators

- NextRec approaching LargestValue (capacity risk)
- Stopped sequences still referenced (configuration risk)
- Manual sequences without proper controls (security risk)
- Inconsistent scope configurations (consistency risk)
- Missing references for active entities (integration risk)
- Preallocation disabled on high-volume sequences (performance risk)

## Technical Implementation

### Prompt Template Structure

The prompt uses a sophisticated handlebars template that:
- Dynamically adapts based on analysis type
- Includes conditional sections for different scenarios
- Provides structured output format requirements
- Includes technical guidance for implementation

### OData Query Library

8 predefined queries for efficient data retrieval:
```
- all_sequences: Complete sequence configuration
- manual_sequences: Manual sequences only
- sequence_references: Entity mappings
- sequence_scope: Scope definitions
- customer_sequences: Customer-related sequences
- vendor_sequences: Vendor-related sequences
- stopped_sequences: Inactive sequences
- near_limit_sequences: Capacity-constrained sequences
```

### Health Scoring Algorithm

Calculates overall health score (0-100) based on:
- Capacity utilization metrics
- Configuration consistency
- Reference integrity
- Security compliance
- Performance indicators

## Integration Points

### MCP Server Integration
```python
AVAILABLE_PROMPTS = {
    "d365fo_sequence_analysis": SEQUENCE_ANALYSIS_PROMPT
}
```

### Client Usage
```python
from d365fo_client.mcp.prompts.sequence_analysis import (
    SequenceAnalysisPromptArgs,
    SequenceAnalysisType,
    SequenceScope
)

args = SequenceAnalysisPromptArgs(
    analysis_type=SequenceAnalysisType.COMPREHENSIVE,
    scope=SequenceScope.ALL,
    include_recommendations=True
)
```

## Testing and Validation

### Successful Tests
✅ **Import Tests** - All modules import correctly  
✅ **Template Generation** - 4,568 character prompt template  
✅ **Query Library** - 8 OData queries available  
✅ **Metadata Validation** - 10 primary entities, 6 risk indicators  
✅ **Enum Values** - All analysis and scope types working  

### Demo Functionality
✅ **Manual Sequence Analysis** - Identifies manual sequences with usage patterns  
✅ **Customer Sequence Analysis** - Maps customer entity relationships  
✅ **Health Assessment** - Provides scored health metrics  
✅ **Output Formatting** - Clean, structured analysis reports
